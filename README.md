# EmployeeManagementSystem-main
Developed a web-based CRUD application to manage employee data with modules for  registration, login, update, and delete using Spring MVC &amp; Hibernate. Used JSP with JSTL for frontend, integrated with Spring Controllers and Service Layer. Built REST-style controller logic, followed MVC architecture, and handled authentication for admin/user  roles.
